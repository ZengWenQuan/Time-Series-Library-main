# Configuration for the SimpleFFNMultiTaskHead
# This configures a simple multi-task head where each target parameter
# is predicted by a separate Feed-Forward Network (FFN).
name : SimpleFFNMultiTaskHead

# The dimension of the flattened feature vector coming from the fusion layer.
# This MUST be set correctly to match the output of the preceding fusion module.
in_features: 512

# A list of integers defining the size of the hidden layers for each FFN.
# The example [256, 128] creates two hidden layers.
# An empty list [] would mean a direct linear mapping from input to output.
hidden_dims: [256, 128]

# The dropout rate to be applied after each hidden layer's activation.
dropout: 0.1
