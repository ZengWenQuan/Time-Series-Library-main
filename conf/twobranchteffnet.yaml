# Configuration for the TwoBranchTeffNet Model

# --- Shared Spectral Encoder (CNN + Transformer) ---
# This encoder is used by both branches to process spectral data.

# 1D Convolutional Patching Layer
patch_conv:
  out_channels: 128  # Dimension of each "patch" feature vector
  kernel_size: 32
  stride: 16

# Transformer Encoder
transformer:
  d_model: 128         # Must match patch_conv.out_channels
  n_heads: 8           # Number of attention heads
  num_layers: 4        # Number of transformer encoder layers
  ffn_dim: 512         # Dimension of the feed-forward network in the transformer
  dropout: 0.2         # Dropout rate within the transformer

# --- Branch 2 Specifics ---

# Cross-Attention Mechanism for conditioning on Teff
cross_attention:
  n_heads: 4           # Can be different from the main transformer

# --- Final Prediction Heads (MLPs) ---

# MLP head for the final prediction of the other 3 parameters
final_head_mlp:
  hidden_dims: [256, 128]
  dropout: 0.3
